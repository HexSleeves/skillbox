# Self-hosting

Skillbox runs on your own Docker host with PostgreSQL. Source builds do not require a hosted Skillbox account, registry login, API key, public domain or host Node/Bun installation. Jev stays optional and requires your own key in Settings.

## Docker-only quick start

From a reviewed source checkout or extracted source release:

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh setup
bash scripts/skillbox.sh start
bash scripts/skillbox.sh status
```

Setup runs the pinned Bun helper in a short-lived network-disabled container using your UID/GID. It generates unique `.env` credentials with mode 0600 on POSIX, never prints their values and refuses to overwrite existing configuration. Read the owner login key locally from `.env`; don't send it to a support channel. Protect equivalent file ACLs on Windows.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4791`. A fresh library is empty. Create skills, a profile and scoped client keys. Provider settings are not required for normal library use.

## LAN or custom port

Choose the actual browser origin and explicit bind address during initial setup:

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh setup --origin http://server.local:8499 --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8499
bash scripts/skillbox.sh start
```

For existing installs, edit only the corresponding values in the protected `.env`: `SKILLBOX_ORIGIN`, `SKILLBOX_BIND_ADDRESS`, and `SKILLBOX_PORT`. Never regenerate owner/database credentials just to change a port. Restart the app deliberately after reviewing config changes.

The default bind is loopback. `0.0.0.0` exposes the app on all IPv4 interfaces; use a firewall and a trusted LAN. **HTTP transmits client credentials and content without encryption. Use HTTPS or an SSH tunnel for untrusted networks.**

The CLI refuses non-local HTTP by default. If you deliberately use a trusted LAN, opt in using `SKILLBOX_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1` or `"allowInsecureHttp": true` in that client's protected config. The optional client installer requires the same explicit JSON option for each HTTP client. This never disables HTTPS certificate validation.

## Optional automatic HTTPS

Point a public DNS name at your host and allow incoming ports 80/443. Add `SKILLBOX_DOMAIN=skills.example.com` using **your own** domain to `.env`, then:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yml -f deploy/compose.caddy.yml up -d --build --wait
```

The override sets the app's canonical origin to the same HTTPS domain. Caddy handles certificates, WebSockets and streaming proxy responses. Certificate state uses persistent Docker volumes. This is opt-in; it is not started by the normal setup command.

If ports 80/443 already belong to a proxy, do not start a second proxy. Use your existing Caddy, Traefik, nginx, Coolify or other ingress to reach the loopback app port, preserve the original host, and configure `SKILLBOX_ORIGIN` to match. Verify the exact published HTTPS URL with certificate validation. Private/Tailscale-only names need your own DNS/certificate approach; this example does not create DNS records or promise public certificates for `.local` names.

For subsequent helper commands using the Caddy deployment, select the same Compose files:

```sh
export COMPOSE_FILE=compose.yml:deploy/compose.caddy.yml
bash scripts/skillbox.sh status
```

## Prebuilt images / Portainer / other Docker platforms

A maintainer can publish a versioned image with `scripts/publish-image.sh` (see below). Until an image is actually published and verified, build from source; no example registry is an operational download URL.

Set `SKILLBOX_IMAGE` in `.env` to your trusted versioned image, preferably `registry/owner/skillbox:VERSION@sha256:INDEX_DIGEST`, then:

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh start-image
```

This pulls and starts without a local build. The helper refuses the local-only default image. The same runtime environment, volumes, healthcheck and port definitions can be used in Portainer or another Compose-compatible platform. When entering a stack manually, remove the `build:` field, supply a real published image and all required variables, and retain private PostgreSQL networking and both persistent volumes. Never paste real `.env` values into a public stack template.

## Mounted startup secrets

For custom Docker, Kubernetes or secret-manager deployments, the server accepts `SKILLBOX_ADMIN_TOKEN_FILE` and `DATABASE_URL_FILE`. Mount those files read-only, set the `_FILE` variables, and omit their non-file equivalents. Supplying both forms is rejected. Grant the container's unprivileged UID 1000 read access through your secret manager or file ownership/ACLs; do not make secrets broadly readable. Files must be nonempty and at most 4 KiB; values and paths are not included in load errors. The stock Compose setup uses the protected `.env` instead.

This is for startup database/owner secrets. TypeSafe AI and Vercel Gateway keys still belong in Settings, separately for each provider, never in an image or global deployment key.

## Back up, recover and upgrade

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh backup
```

Backups go to ignored `backups/`: a PostgreSQL custom-format dump and, when present, a matching mode-0600 `.env` sidecar. The sidecar contains secrets. Keep both private and off-host; protect separately supplied secret files too. Archive listing verifies structure, not complete recovery—test a restore in a separate instance.

To restore into the intended Compose project, first back up its current state, review the target and retain the backup's matching owner token:

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh restore /absolute/path/to/backup.dump --confirm-replace-database
```

**Restore replaces that project's database.** The helper checks the archive, stops only its app, restores with errors enabled, and restarts only on success. It does not overwrite `.env`. Restore the matching configuration deliberately; a different owner token cannot decrypt old integration settings. On failure, the app stays stopped for inspection.

For source deployments, review/check out the desired release, then:

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh upgrade
```

For prebuilt deployments, set the new image reference and use `upgrade-image`. Both take a backup first. No automatic Git pull, uncommitted-work overwrite or database-major upgrade is attempted by the source helper. Never change the PostgreSQL major version without a separate migration/restore plan.

`stop` preserves all data. Do not run `docker compose down -v` against an installation you want to retain.

## Diagnose without dumping configuration

```sh
bash scripts/skillbox.sh doctor
bash scripts/skillbox.sh logs app
```

Doctor validates Compose quietly and shows service status; it does not print expanded secrets. Containers expose `/healthz`, which checks database access. Keep logs/private backups out of public bug reports. Common failures: missing/wrong origin, occupied port, database not healthy, changed owner token, or unreadable mounted secrets.

## Publish a release image (maintainers)

From a clean, tested source commit, using your own existing registry login and a Buildx builder supporting both amd64 and arm64:

```sh
bash scripts/publish-image.sh registry/owner/skillbox:VERSION https://public-source.example/project --push
```

The script does not log in, install emulation, alter registry visibility, create builders or enable CI. It refuses a builder lacking either architecture. Test both native runtimes before claiming support. Publishing from this command is explicit and may use registry/build resources.

For Umbrel, images must also be anonymously pullable and digest-pinned. See [the Umbrel release gates](../deploy/umbrel/README.md). A successful authenticated push is not proof that other users can pull the image.
